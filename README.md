# How to get skiovox on v125 or v126 
Go to https://github.com/blitzbrian/Skiovox-v125/ for the original instructions (some stuff wont make sense since I changed it)

# How to download this modified version
1. Click on the 2.4.4 (latest) on the left and then download the "skiovox-v125-new.zip" file
2. Open the chromeos file explorer and find where you stored the extracted orignal skiovox-125 version
3. Extract the new zip
4. Copy the extracted zip inside the first skiovox folder (there should be one that leads to another and inside that other one is the one that has the files)
5. Rename the orginal skio to something slightly different
6. Rename the new skio to exactly what the old one WAS named.
7. Open a new tab
8. Profit

# THIS DOESNT MAKE SKIO WORK ON NEWER VERSIONS ITS JUST A DIFFERENT STYLE NEW TAB

blitzbrian (for the repo and extension) PS. Your code kinda sucked you used querySelectorAll('svg") in order instead of by class or id...
